Navigating this crowded landscape can be daunting for anyone, which often leads to more than usual time consumption and costly variations in quality, price fluctuations, long delivery times, broken promises and commitments, and unethical dealings and business practices.

That is where AGRI AID comes to the aid. It acts as a single gateway, specifically developed to assist folks in finding the most relevant information and services that they need to progress their development or investment in agriculture.

## The following services are provided:-
1. Soil check
2. Water check
3. Food check
4. Seed check

## Apart from this AGRI AID provides features like:-
1. Market for dealers and provides market price
2. Revenue predictor
3. News regarding agriculture
